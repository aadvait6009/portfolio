            <h3>Artificial Intelligence and <span>Machine Learning enthusiast</span></h3>
            <p>As an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning enthusiast, I've actively engaged in various projects within my field of study. One notable project I've developed is a Gym Trainer Software designed to accurately count repetitions and curls during workouts. Utilizing Python, I crafted an intuitive solution that leverages advanced algorithms to track movements and provide real-time feedback, enhancing the training experience.</p>
            <p>Beyond my proficiency in Python, I possess foundational knowledge in C programming, HTML, and Java. These languages have empowered me to explore diverse aspects of software development and broaden my skill set.</p>
            <p>With a keen interest in leveraging technology to improve everyday experiences, I aspire to continue innovating and contributing to the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Through ongoing learning and hands-on projects, I am committed to making meaningful strides in this dynamic and transformative field.</p>
